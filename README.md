# Keycloak Package
Ready to use docker image for NodeJS with Keycloak


Overview
--------

This is a Keycloak project that demonstrates how to implement authentication and authorization using the Keycloak Identity and Access Management platform. The project includes a simple web application that allows users to register, log in, and access protected resources.

Getting Started
---------------

1. Clone the project repository: `git clone https://github.com/kerrickdev/keycloak`
2. Install the required dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the Keycloak server: `npm start`
4. Access the web application: `http://localhost:8080`

Keycloak Configuration
--------------------

The Keycloak configuration file is located at `keycloak.json`. This file contains the settings for the Keycloak server, including the realm, client, and user credentials.

Realms
-------

The realm is the top-level container for the Keycloak configuration. It defines the name of the realm, the authentication mechanisms, and the roles that are available.

Clients
-------

The client is the entity that is requesting authentication. In this case, the client is the web application. The client configuration includes the client ID, client secret, and the redirect URI.

Users
-----

The users are the individuals who will be accessing the protected resources. The user configuration includes the user ID, username, email, and password.

Roles
-----

Roles define the permissions that a user has within the realm. In this case, the roles are "user" and "admin". The "user" role has read-only access to the protected resources, while the "admin" role has read-write access.

Protected Resources
-------------------

The protected resources are the resources that are protected by Keycloak. In this case, the protected resources are the JSON data files located in the `data` directory.

Accessing Protected Resources
----------------------------

To access the protected resources, users must first authenticate with the Keycloak server. Once authenticated, the user's role is checked to determine whether they have access to the requested resource. If the user has the appropriate role, the resource is returned to the user. Otherwise, an error is returned.
